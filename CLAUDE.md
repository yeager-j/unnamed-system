# Persona System — Character Sheet App

A Next.js web app for creating and managing characters in the Persona System tabletop RPG. The game rules live in `/Users/jackson/Obsidian/Persona System/` (an Obsidian vault with a comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` index). The product spec is in that vault's `PRD.md`.

## Repo Structure

Turborepo monorepo with npm workspaces:

```
apps/web/          Next.js 16 app (App Router, RSC, Server Actions)
packages/ui/       Shared component library (shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4)
packages/eslint-config/
packages/typescript-config/
```

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start all packages in watch mode (Turbopack)
npm run build      # Production build
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit across all packages
npm run lint       # ESLint across all packages
npm run format     # Prettier across all packages
```

Run app-specific commands from the package directory (e.g., `cd apps/web && npm run dev`).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16, App Router, React Server Components, Server Actions
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Phosphor Icons
- **Auth**: Auth.js v5 (NextAuth) with Google OAuth only; Drizzle adapter
- **Database**: Neon Postgres via Drizzle ORM; migrations via `drizzle-kit`
- **Storage**: Vercel Blob for portrait uploads
- **Validation**: Zod + react-hook-form; same Zod schemas validate Server Action inputs
- **Short IDs**: nanoid (8-char URL-safe) for public character URLs `/c/{shortId}`
- **Hosting**: Vercel + Neon + Vercel Blob
- **Testing**: Vitest (game mechanics unit tests), Playwright (E2E for builder + cast/heal/rest loop)

Game data (Archetypes, Skills, Talents, Ailments) is **hardcoded TypeScript** in the repo — not in the database.

## Game Rules the App Must Understand

The full rules are in the Obsidian vault. What follows is the subset the app enforces or computes.

### Stats

**Attributes** (Strength, Magic, Agility, Luck): set entirely by the active Archetype's stat block. Not accumulated via leveling. Hard cap ±7. Apply in priority order: active Archetype score + permanent Mastery bonuses + equipped item bonuses. Clamp result to ±7.

**Virtues** (Expression, Empathy, Wisdom, Focus): Rank 0–7 each. Separate from Attributes; used for social/exploration checks. Created with +2 to one Virtue, +1 to two others, 0 to the fourth.

**HP/SP**: Determined by path choice at creation:
- Health-Focused: d12 Hit Die / d8 Skill Die, starting 24 HP / 40 SP
- Balanced: d10 / d10, starting 20 HP / 50 SP
- Skill-Focused: d8 / d12, starting 16 HP / 60 SP

Max HP = path starting HP + sum of Hit Die results on level-up + permanent HP bonuses (Mastery, equipment). MVP uses averages only (no player-rolled dice for level-up HP gain — the app accepts a player-entered roll result for Respite/Partial Rest die spending).

**Affinities** (11 damage types: Slash, Pierce, Strike, Fire, Ice, Wind, Elec, Aether, Psy, Light, Dark; plus Almighty): Priority order highest→lowest: Drain > Repel > Null > Resist > Neutral > Weak. Display the highest-priority source that applies. Sources: active Archetype's chart → equipment overrides → Skill overrides in the active Archetype's Inheritance Slots.

### Archetypes

Jobs/classes. One active at a time; switch only at a Respite. Each Archetype has Ranks 1–5. Mastering (Rank 5) grants a **permanent** bonus (specific to that Archetype) that persists even when inactive — but Attribute cap still applies. Each Archetype has a fixed number of Inheritance Slots (initiate tier = 2); slots hold a Skill from any other unlocked Archetype's available Skills at the character's current Rank in that source Archetype. Synthesis Skills cannot be inherited.

Origin Archetype: the one chosen at creation. Sets Rank 2 and unlocks Ranks 1–2 Skills. Also determines which Paragon Archetype is eventually unlockable (display-only at MVP).

Archetype Ranks are gained from leveling (+2 per level). They can be spent to rank up any unlocked Archetype or saved.

MVP ships four Archetypes: **Warrior, Knight, Mage, Healer**.

### Skill Casting

Each Skill costs either flat SP or a percentage of max HP. Resolve percentage costs against current max HP at display time (show concrete numbers). Disable Cast button if the character can't pay: current SP < SP cost, or current HP ≤ HP cost (can't drop to 0 HP by casting). On cast: deduct the resolved cost from the appropriate pool. Log the action (last 10, undoable). The app never rolls damage or applies effects to targets.

### Leveling

Victories threshold: 7 (Heroic Victory = 2; overflow carries forward). On level-up:
1. +1 Hit Die + +2 Skill Dice (player enters result or takes average; add to max HP and max SP)
2. +2 Archetype Ranks (spendable now or saved)
3. Victories decremented by 7; overflow carries

Max level: 30.

### Sparks & Virtue Rank-Up

Spark log holds 0–7 Sparks, each tagged with a Virtue. At 7 Sparks, surface a "Rank up" CTA. Eligible Virtues are those represented at least once in the current log. On rank-up: chosen Virtue +1 Rank, log clears entirely.

### Resting

- **Full Rest**: restore HP and SP to max, restore all spent dice, Exhaustion −1
- **Partial Rest**: restore HP to max; player chooses Skill Dice to spend for SP (app accepts player-entered result per die, deducts the dice)
- **Respite**: player chooses Hit Dice to spend for HP (same model); no SP recovery

### Prisma

Each character carries a Prisma flask. Default max 2 charges. "Use Prisma" decrements by 1. Player rolls and adjusts HP manually. Refills to max on Full Rest. Upgrade tree is deferred (rules are also TODO).

### Combat State (tracked, not computed)

Current ailment (one at a time; 13 possible), Battle Conditions (Attack/Defense/Hit-Evasion each: neutral/increased/decreased with stack counts), Charged toggle, Concentrating toggle, Exhaustion level. A "Clear combat state" button wipes all after combat.

## Data Model (Key Entities)

`User`, `Character` (with `shortId` for `/c/{shortId}` public URLs), `CharacterArchetype` (join with rank, inheritanceSlots, masteryBonusApplied), `CharacterKnife`, `CharacterChain`, `CharacterTalent`, `InventoryItem` (kind: weapon | armor | accessory | other; effects: affinity | attribute | skill), `ActionLogEntry`.

See PRD §8 for the full field list.

## App Surfaces

1. **Home / My Characters** — list of user's characters, "Create new character" CTA
2. **Character Builder** — 12-step linear flow (savable, back-navigable); see PRD §5
3. **Character Sheet (edit)** — owner's editable view; header, vitals, attributes, virtues, affinities, archetypes, skills, talents, equipment, identity, progression, combat state, notes
4. **Character Sheet (public)** — `/c/{shortId}`, read-only, same content, signed-out visible

## MVP Scope Limits

- No DM tooling, campaigns, or group features
- No dice rolling — app accepts player-entered numbers where rolls are required
- No Archetype prerequisite enforcement (display prerequisites as informational only)
- No Ancestry/Background structure — free text fields only
- No Prisma upgrade tree
- No Spoils deck simulation
- No multi-currency
- No item catalog — items are user-defined
- Game data changes require a redeploy

## Rulebook Reference

The full rules are indexed in `/Users/jackson/Obsidian/Persona System/CLAUDE.md`. When in doubt about a mechanic, read the relevant file from that vault rather than guessing.
