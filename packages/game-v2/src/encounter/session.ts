 * entity** (D29): it is a container of four v1 scalars (carried verbatim — same
 * names, nullability, vocab) plus an ordered `Participant[]`.
 *
 * The **F1 kill**: the runtime {@link Participant} carries **no storage
 * discriminant**. v1's `CombatantRef` (`pc | enemy | catalog-enemy`) union
 * dissolves into a uniform `entity` — every consumer (`resolve`, the reducer,
 * redaction, initiative, fallen, party-composition) reads `participant.entity`
 * with zero `kind` branch. The durable-vs-inline **storage** home lives only at
 * the app boundary (UNN-516's impure out-of-band locator map), never here.

 * One combatant in the encounter: a stable roster `id`, the dissolved `entity`

 * overlay + turn-order key on the roster id, and a durable entity could in
 * principle appear twice. The wrapper is retained (not collapsed to `Entity[]`)
 * precisely to home the overlay beside — never inside — `entity.components`, so
 * transient ailments/turn-state never leak across encounters via the entity row.
