/**
 * The **single source of truth** for the component vocabulary (D16). `Entity`,
 * the capability views (`Has<K>`), and the runtime `guard` all derive from this
 * registry, so adding a capability is one key here and everything follows.
 *
 * ## How the registry grows (the one rule for every domain PR)
 *
 * This interface is the **authoritative grow-point**. Each domain PR adds its
 * component by editing this file: one `type`-only import of the domain's schema
 * type, and one line in the interface. Example, when `vitals` lands:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import type { Vitals } from "@workspace/game-v2/vitals/vitals.schema"
 * export interface ComponentRegistry {
 *   identity: Identity
 *   vitals: Vitals   // ← added by the vitals PR
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This file, `ports.ts`, and `load-seam.ts` are the **only** kernel files allowed
 * to name a domain shape — the three "knows every component" grow-points (the
 * authored type map here, the catalog lookups in ports, the total Zod schema map
 * in load-seam). They name domain types to declare the registry/port, exactly as
 * v1's `engine/ports.ts` type-imports foundation types. The type-only import is
 * erased, so kernel keeps zero runtime dependency on a domain. The alternative
 * (TS `declare module` augmentation from each domain) was rejected: it hides the
 * registry's true shape, still needs the same type-import to name the component,
 * and risks tree-shaking dropping an augmentation under `sideEffects: false`.
 *
 * PR1 seeds the registry with the universal {@link Identity} component.
