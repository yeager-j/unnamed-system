 * module that implemented the port (or produced `Position`) would import
 * `encounter/` and break the one-way seam (SD2). The combat side wraps these
 * `satisfies SpatialReads` and projects the occupancy token into the read-bag
 * (`encounter/spatial-adapter.ts`); the adapter hop is what keeps the dependency
 * one-way.
 *
 * The `tokenKey` is the occupancy key — opaque and dual-lifecycle (a `participantId`
 * in combat, a `characterId` in exploration, SD5); these selectors treat it as a
