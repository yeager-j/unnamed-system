 * - **Stats, drop to opponent + spectator** — `attributes`, `affinities` (RED-4).
 * - **Drop from all five** — resolved read-units that never belong on a watch
 *   surface (`skills`/`talents`/`resources`/`exhaustion`/`archetypes`/`virtues`/
 *   `narrative` are sheet data, never in v1's snapshot; `pendingEffects`
