 * adapter once; this module re-exports the pre-bound functions, so app code
 * never threads the catalog by hand and the binding stays confined here.
 *
 * Deliberately minimal: only the functions an app surface already consumes are
 * re-exported (UNN-530 binds `resolveSession` for the snapshot read boundary;
 * UNN-533 binds the sheet derivation). PR11 (UNN-510) grows this as the
 * console/watch flip to v2.
