# `lib/character` — the character read side (ADR §2.6)

The v2 character surfaces' read layer: **one load boundary per route** and,
when S2 lands, the pure per-surface view builders.

- `load.ts` — `loadCharacterByShortId(shortId)` fetches the `entity` row once,
  assembles + `resolveEntity`s once, and returns the
  `{ profile, entity, resolved }` triple. `profile` is the app-owned columns;
  `entity` is the authored component bag (the optimistic re-fold's base and
  where surfaces read authored choices); `resolved` is the engine's read-units.
  `loadCharactersByIds(ids)` is the batch twin (the dungeon watch's own-sheet
  column, UNN-566): same triple per id, in the caller's order, skipping a row
  that fails the load seam rather than 404ing a whole watch page.
  `toCharacterProfile(row)` is the profile projection alone, for the loaders
  that already hold a dissolved entity (a durable combatant off the session).
- `view/` (S2a — UNN-557) — pure per-surface view builders over that triple,
  mirroring `lib/combat/view/`: `rail-view.ts` (the sheet's persistent rail —
  note Level/Victories read off the authored `entity`, no resolved read-unit
  exists), `affinity-strip.ts` (11 cells, neutral-filled), `skill-sources.ts`
  (per-skill provenance labels for the card's effect line). Skill cards
  themselves render `ResolvedSkill` directly — no per-card view type. **There
  is no shared flattener** — no `HydratedCharacter` successor. A shared view
  slice may exist only when two surfaces genuinely render the same one, and it
  is named for its content, never its storage (the F1 tripwire: a view type
  with a `durable`/`row` discriminant is the kind branch resurfacing).

**Nothing in this folder computes.** Derivation happens in the engine
(`resolveEntity`), shaping in `view/`, rendering in components (anti-goal 1).
Writes never live here — they are `lib/entity/commit` descriptors dispatched
through `lib/actions/entity/`.

## ⚠️ The three read homes are deliberate — do not merge them

A surface reads from exactly three places, each answering a different
question:

| Home                | Question it answers                  | Example reads                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `profile`           | app-owned row facts                  | name, status, builderStep, version tokens      |
| `entity.components` | what the player **authored**         | `path.choice`, `archetypes.origin`, narrative  |
| `resolved`          | what the engine **derived** from it  | `vitals.maxHP/currentHP`, resolved skills      |

The standing temptation — it will look like a harmless convenience — is to
spread these into one merged view-model ("`CharacterView`", "`SheetData`",
a context that flattens all three). **Don't.** That object is
`HydratedCharacter` reborn: the moment authored and derived values share a
namespace, readers stop knowing which is which, writes start targeting
derived fields, and the shadow flattener the whole v2 read model exists to
kill (ADR §2.6, anti-goal 2) grows back one field at a time. If a component
needs values from two homes, it takes two props (or a per-surface `view/`
builder shapes them) — the *builder* may combine, because it is pure,
per-surface, and content-named; a *shared* merged type may not exist.
